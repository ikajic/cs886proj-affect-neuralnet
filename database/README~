## EPA repository

This directory is a repository of affective EPA values.
They have been organized in different files for easier handling by the program.
Some files contain only EPA values for identities, some for behaviors and
settings, and others are a combination thereof.
All values here have been extracted either form the (Interact
software)[http://www.indiana.edu/~socpsy/ACT/interact.htm] or the (ACT
website)[http://www.indiana.edu/~socpsy/ACT/interact/subcultures/sex_averages.htm].
